# CliniCal

Clini.Cal is a healthcare scheduling platform that simplifies the process of booking medical appointments. It allows patients to find and book appointments with their preferred healthcare providers. It offers real-time appointment availability, along with the option to track the live wait times for pharmacies as well as medical office waiting rooms for patients wanting to do a walk-in. It sends automated reminders to patients to book their yearly appointments months in advance before desired dates get scheduled, as appointments aren’t normally available for 1+ months from the point you’re trying to schedule. Patients can now have more control over their time by efficiently managing their schedules, reducing waiting times, and optimizing their appointments. The platform also offers a chatbot to help provide general recommendations of services for the patient.
